/**
 * Who is signed in, resolved once for the whole console.
 *
 * On a static host there is no server to check a session before a page renders,
 * so the gate lives here instead. That makes it a *convenience*, not a security
 * boundary — anyone can download this JavaScript and skip it. What they cannot
 * skip is Row Level Security: the anon key below is public by design, and every
 * row it can read or write is decided by policy in Postgres.
 *
 * Practical consequence: never put anything in a table that the reader is not
 * allowed to see. There is no server-side filter to fall back on.
